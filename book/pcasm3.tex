\section{Shift Operations\index{bit operations!shifts|(}}

Assembly language allows the programmer to manipulate the individual bits
of data. One common bit operation is called a \emph{shift}. A shift operation
moves the position of the bits of some data. Shifts can be either toward the
left (\emph{i.e.} toward the most significant bits) or toward the right
(the least significant bits).

\subsection{Logical shifts\index{bit operations!shifts!logical shifts|(}}

A logical shift is the simplest type of shift. It shifts in a very 
straightforward manner. Figure~\ref{fig:logshifts} shows an example of a
shifted single byte number.

\hline%\cline{2-9}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Logical shifts \label{fig:logshifts}}
\end{figure}

Note that new, incoming bits are always zero. The {\code SHL}
\index{SHL} and {\code SHR} \index{SHR} instructions are used to
perform logical left and right shifts respectively.  These
instructions allow one to shift by any number of positions. The number
of positions to shift can either be a constant or can be stored in the
{\code CL} register. The last bit shifted out of the data is stored in
the carry flag. Here are some code examples:
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    ax, 0C123H
      shl    ax, 1           ; shift 1 bit to left,   ax = 8246H, CF = 1
      shr    ax, 1           ; shift 1 bit to right,  ax = 4123H, CF = 0
      shr    ax, 1           ; shift 1 bit to right,  ax = 2091H, CF = 1
      mov    ax, 0C123H
      shl    ax, 2           ; shift 2 bits to left,  ax = 048CH, CF = 1
      mov    cl, 3
      shr    ax, cl          ; shift 3 bits to right, ax = 0091H, CF = 1
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Use of shifts}

Fast multiplication and division are the most common uses of a shift
operations. Recall that in the decimal system, multiplication and
division by a power of ten are simple, just shift digits. The same is
true for powers of two in binary. For example, to double the binary
number $1011_2$ (or 11 in decimal), shift once to the left to get
$10110_2$ (or 22). The quotient of a division by a power of two is the
result of a right shift. To divide by just 2, use a single right
shift; to divide by 4 ($2^2$), shift right 2 places; to divide by 8
($2^3$), shift 3 places to the right, \emph{etc.} Shift instructions
are very basic and are \emph{much} faster than the corresponding
{\code MUL} \index{MUL} and {\code DIV} \index{DIV} instructions!

Actually, logical shifts can be used to multiply and divide unsigned
values. They do not work in general for signed values. Consider the
2-byte value FFFF (signed $-1$). If it is logically right shifted
once, the result is 7FFF which is $+32,767$! Another type of shift can
be used for signed values.  
\index{bit operations!shifts!logical shifts|)}

\subsection{Arithmetic shifts\index{bit operations!shifts!arithmetic shifts|(}}

These shifts are designed to allow signed numbers to be quickly multiplied
and divided by powers of 2. They insure that the sign bit is treated 
correctly.
\begin{description}
\item[SAL] \index{SAL} Shift Arithmetic Left - This instruction is just a synonym for
           {\code SHL}. It is assembled into the exactly the same machine
           code as {\code SHL}. As long as the sign bit is not changed by
           the shift, the result will be correct.
\item[SAR] \index{SAR} Shift Arithmetic Right - This is a new instruction that does
           not shift the sign bit (\emph{i.e.} the msb) of its operand. The
           other bits are shifted as normal except that the new bits that 
           enter from the left are copies of the sign bit (that is, if the 
           sign bit is 1, the new bits are also 1). Thus, if a byte is shifted
           with this instruction, only the lower 7 bits are shifted. As for
           the other shifts, the last bit shifted out is stored in the
           carry flag.
\end{description}

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    ax, 0C123H
      sal    ax, 1           ; ax = 8246H, CF = 1
      sal    ax, 1           ; ax = 048CH, CF = 1
      sar    ax, 2           ; ax = 0123H, CF = 0
\end{lstlisting}
\index{bit operations!shifts!arithmetic shifts|)}

\subsection{Rotate shifts\index{bit operations!shifts!rotates|(}}

The rotate shift instructions work like logical shifts except that
bits lost off one end of the data are shifted in on the other
side. Thus, the data is treated as if it is a circular structure. The
two simplest rotate instructions are {\code ROL} \index{ROL} and
{\code ROR} \index{ROR} which make left and right rotations,
respectively. Just as for the other shifts, these shifts leave the a
copy of the last bit shifted around in the carry flag.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    ax, 0C123H
      rol    ax, 1           ; ax = 8247H, CF = 1
      rol    ax, 1           ; ax = 048FH, CF = 1
      rol    ax, 1           ; ax = 091EH, CF = 0
      ror    ax, 2           ; ax = 8247H, CF = 1
      ror    ax, 1           ; ax = C123H, CF = 1
\end{lstlisting}

There are two additional rotate instructions that shift the bits in
the data and the carry flag named {\code RCL} \index{RCL} and {\code
RCR}. \index{RCR} For example, if the {\code AX} register is rotated
with these instructions, the 17-bits made up of {\code AX} and the
carry flag are rotated.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    ax, 0C123H
      clc                    ; clear the carry flag (CF = 0)
      rcl    ax, 1           ; ax = 8246H, CF = 1
      rcl    ax, 1           ; ax = 048DH, CF = 1
      rcl    ax, 1           ; ax = 091BH, CF = 0
      rcr    ax, 2           ; ax = 8246H, CF = 1
      rcr    ax, 1           ; ax = C123H, CF = 0
\end{lstlisting}
\index{bit operations!shifts!rotates|)}

\subsection{Simple application\label{sect:AddBitsExample}}

Here is a code snippet that counts the number of bits that are ``on''
(\emph{i.e.}~1) in the EAX register.
%TODO: show how the ADC instruction could be used to remove the jnc
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    bl, 0           ; bl will contain the count of ON bits
      mov    ecx, 32         ; ecx is the loop counter
count_loop:
      shl    eax, 1          ; shift bit into carry flag
      jnc    skip_inc        ; if CF == 0, goto skip_inc
      inc    bl
skip_inc:
      loop   count_loop
\end{lstlisting}
The above code destroys the original value of {\code EAX} ({\code EAX} is zero
at the end of the loop). If one wished to retain the value of {\code EAX},
line~4 could be replaced with {\code rol  eax, 1}.

\section{Boolean Bitwise Operations}

There are four common boolean operators: \emph{AND}, \emph{OR}, \emph{XOR} and
\emph{NOT}. A \emph{truth table} shows the result of each operation for each
possible value of its operands.

\subsection{The \emph{AND} operation\index{bit operations!AND}}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\emph{X} & \emph{Y} & \emph{X} AND \emph{Y} \\
\hline \hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The AND operation \label{tab:and} \index{AND}}
\end{table}

The result of the \emph{AND} of two bits is only 1 if both bits are 1, else
the result is 0 as the truth table in Table~\ref{tab:and} shows.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rcccccccc}
    & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
AND & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
    & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{tabular}
\caption{ANDing a byte \label{fig:and}}
\end{figure}

Processors support these operations as instructions that act 
independently on all the bits of data in parallel. For example, if the contents
of {\code AL} and {\code BL} are \emph{AND}ed together, the basic \emph{AND}
operation is applied to each of the 8 pairs of corresponding bits in the
two registers as Figure~\ref{fig:and} shows. Below is a code example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    ax, 0C123H
      and    ax, 82F6H          ; ax = 8022H
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{The \emph{OR} operation\index{bit operations!OR}}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\emph{X} & \emph{Y} & \emph{X} OR \emph{Y} \\
\hline \hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The OR operation \label{tab:or} \index{OR}}
\end{table}


The inclusive \emph{OR} of 2 bits is 0 only if both bits are 0, else
the result is 1 as the truth table in Table~\ref{tab:or} shows. Below
is a code example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    ax, 0C123H
      or     ax, 0E831H          ; ax = E933H
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{The \emph{XOR} operation\index{bit operations!XOR}}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\emph{X} & \emph{Y} & \emph{X} XOR \emph{Y} \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The XOR operation \label{tab:xor}\index{XOR}}
\end{table}


The exclusive \emph{OR} of 2 bits is 0 if and only if both bits
are equal, else the result is 1 as the truth table in
Table~\ref{tab:xor} shows. Below is a code example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    ax, 0C123H
      xor    ax, 0E831H          ; ax = 2912H
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{The \emph{NOT} operation\index{bit operations!NOT}}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\emph{X} & NOT \emph{X} \\
\hline
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The NOT operation \label{tab:not}\index{NOT}}
\end{table}

The \emph{NOT} operation is a \emph{unary} operation (\emph{i.e.} it
acts on one operand, not two like \emph{binary} operations such as
\emph{AND}).  The \emph{NOT} of a bit is the opposite value of the bit
as the truth table in Table~\ref{tab:not} shows. Below is a code
example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    ax, 0C123H
      not    ax                 ; ax = 3EDCH
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the \emph{NOT} finds the one's complement. Unlike the other
bitwise operations, the {\code NOT} instruction does not change any of
the bits in the {\code FLAGS} register.

\subsection{The {\code TEST} instruction\index{TEST}}

The {\code TEST} instruction performs an \emph{AND} operation, but
does not store the result. It only sets the {\code FLAGS} register
based on what the result would be (much like how the {\code CMP}
instruction performs a subtraction but only sets {\code FLAGS}). For
example, if the result would be zero, {\code ZF} would be set.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{lp{3in}}
Turn on bit \emph{i} & \emph{OR} the number with $2^i$ (which is
                              the binary number with just bit \emph{i} on) \\
Turn off bit \emph{i} & \emph{AND} the number with the binary number with
                              only bit \emph{i} off. This operand is often
                  	      called a \emph{mask} \\
Complement bit \emph{i} & \emph{XOR} the number with $2^i$
\end{tabular}
\caption{Uses of boolean operations \label{tab:bool}}
\end{table}

\section{Uses of Bit Operations\index{bit operations!assembly|(}}

Bit operations are very useful for manipulating individual bits of data
without modifying the other bits. Table~\ref{tab:bool} shows three common
uses of these operations. Below is some example code, implementing these
ideas.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    ax, 0C123H
      or     ax, 8           ; turn on bit 3,   ax = C12BH
      and    ax, 0FFDFH      ; turn off bit 5,  ax = C10BH
      xor    ax, 8000H       ; invert bit 15,   ax = 410BH
      or     ax, 0F00H       ; turn on nibble,  ax = 4F0BH
      and    ax, 0FFF0H      ; turn off nibble, ax = 4F00H
      xor    ax, 0F00FH      ; invert nibbles,  ax = BF0FH
      xor    ax, 0FFFFH      ; 1's complement,  ax = 40F0H
\end{lstlisting}

The \emph{AND} operation can also be used to find the remainder of a
division by a power of two. To find the remainder of a division by
$2^i$, \emph{AND} the number with a mask equal to $2^i - 1$. This mask will
contain ones from bit 0 up to bit $i-1$. It is just these bits that contain
the remainder. The result of the \emph{AND} will keep these bits and
zero out the others. Next is a snippet of code that finds the quotient and
remainder of the division of 100 by 16.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    eax, 100        ; 100 = 64H
      mov    ebx, 0000000FH  ; mask = 16 - 1 = 15 or F
      and    ebx, eax        ; ebx = remainder = 4
      shr    eax, 4          ; eax = quotient of eax/2^4 = 6
\end{lstlisting}
Using the {\code CL} register it is possible to modify arbitrary bits of data.
Next is an example that sets (turns on) an arbitrary bit in {\code EAX}. The
number of the bit to set is stored in {\code BH}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    cl, bh          ; first build the number to OR with
      mov    ebx, 1
      shl    ebx, cl         ; shift left cl times
      or     eax, ebx        ; turn on bit
\end{lstlisting}
Turning a bit off is just a little harder.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    cl, bh          ; first build the number to AND with
      mov    ebx, 1
      shl    ebx, cl         ; shift left cl times
      not    ebx             ; invert bits
      and    eax, ebx        ; turn off bit
\end{lstlisting}
Code to complement an arbitrary bit is left as an exercise for the reader.

It is not uncommon to see the following puzzling instruction in a 80x86
program:
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler},numbers=none]
      xor    eax, eax         ; eax = 0
\end{lstlisting}
A number \emph{XOR}'ed with itself always results in zero. This instruction
is used because its machine code is smaller than the corresponding 
{\code MOV} instruction.
\index{bit operations!assembly|)}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]
      mov    bl, 0           ; bl will contain the count of ON bits
      mov    ecx, 32         ; ecx is the loop counter
count_loop:
      shl    eax, 1          ; shift bit into carry flag
      adc    bl, 0           ; add just the carry flag to bl
      loop   count_loop
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Counting bits with {\code ADC}\label{fig:countBitsAdc}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Avoiding Conditional Branches}
\index{branch prediction|(} 

Modern processors use very sophisticated techniques to execute code as
quickly as possible. One common technique is known as
\emph{speculative execution}\index{speculative execution}. This
technique uses the parallel processing capabilities of the CPU to
execute multiple instructions at once. Conditional branches present a
problem with this idea. The processor, in general, does not know
whether the branch will be taken or not. If it is taken, a different
set of instructions will be executed than if it is not
taken. Processors try to predict whether the branch will be taken. If
the prediciton is wrong, the processor has wasted its time executing
the wrong code.

\index{branch prediction|)}

One way to avoid this problem is to avoid using conditional branches
when possible. The sample code in \ref{sect:AddBitsExample} provides a
simple example of where one could do this. In the previous example, the
``on'' bits of the EAX register are counted. It uses a branch to skip
the {\code INC} instruction. Figure~\ref{fig:countBitsAdc} shows how
the branch can be removed by using the {\code ADC}\index{ADC}
instruction to add the carry flag directly.

The {\code SET\emph{xx}}\index{SET\emph{xx}} instructions provide a
way to remove branches in certain cases. These instructions set the
value of a byte register or memory location to zero or one based on
the state of the FLAGS register.  The characters after {\code SET} are
the same characters used for conditional branches. If the
corresponding condition of the {\code SET\emph{xx}} is true, the result stored
is a one, if false a zero is stored. For example,
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler},numbers=none]
      setz   al        ; AL = 1 if Z flag is set, else 0
\end{lstlisting}
Using these instructions, one can develop some clever techniques that
calculate values without branches.

For example, consider the problem of finding the maximum of two values.
The standard approach to solving this problem would be to use a {\code
CMP} and use a conditional branch to act on which value was larger. The
example program below shows how the maximum can be found without any 
branches.

\lstinputlisting{../code/max.asm}

The trick is to create a bit mask that can be used to select the
correct value for the maximum. The {\code SETG}\index{SETG}
instruction in line~17 sets BL to 1 if the second input is the maximum
or 0 otherwise. This is not quite the bit mask desired. To create the
required bit mask, line~18 uses the {\code NEG}\index{NEG} instruction
on the entire EBX register. (Note that EBX was zeroed out earlier.)
If EBX is 0, this does nothing; however, if EBX is 1, the result is
the two's complement representation of -1 or 0xFFFFFFFF. This is just
the bit mask required. The remaining code uses this bit mask to select
the correct input as the maximum.

An alternative trick is to use the {\code DEC} statement. In the above
code, if the {\code NEG} is replaced with a {\code DEC}, again the result
will either be 0 or 0xFFFFFFFF. However, the values are reversed than
when using the {\code NEG} instruction.


\section{Manipulating Bits in C\index{bit operations!C|(}}

\subsection{The bitwise operators of C}

Unlike some high-level languages, C does provide operators for bitwise
operations. The \emph{AND} operation is represented by the binary
{\code \&} operator\footnote{This operator is different from the
binary {\code \&\&} and unary {\code \&} operators!}. The \emph{OR}
operation is represented by the binary {\code |} operator. The
\emph{XOR} operation is represented by the binary {\code \verb|^| 
}operator. And the \emph{NOT} operation is represented by the unary
{\code \verb|~| }operator.

The shift operations are performed by C's {\code <<} and {\code >>}
binary operators. The {\code <<} operator performs left shifts and the 
{\code >>} operator performs right shifts. These operators take two
operands. The left operand is the value to shift and the right operand is
the number of bits to shift by. If the value to shift is an unsigned type,
a logical shift is made. If the value is a signed type (like {\code int}),
then an arithmetic shift is used. Below is some example C code using these
operators:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]{}
short int s;          /* assume that short int is 16-bit */
short unsigned u;
s = -1;               /* s = 0xFFFF (2's complement) */
u = 100;              /* u = 0x0064 */
u = u | 0x0100;       /* u = 0x0164 */
s = s & 0xFFF0;       /* s = 0xFFF0 */
s = s ^ u;            /* s = 0xFE94 */
u = u << 3;           /* u = 0x0B20 (logical shift) */
s = s >> 2;           /* s = 0xFFA5 (arithmetic shift) */
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Using bitwise operators in C}

The bitwise operators are used in C for the same purposes as they are used
in assembly language. They allow one to manipulate individual bits of data
and can be used for fast multiplication and division. In fact, a smart C
compiler will use a shift for a multiplication like, {\code x *= 2}, 
automatically.

\end{table}

Many operating system API\footnote{Application Programming
Interface}'s (such as \emph{POSIX}\footnote{stands for Portable
Operating System Interface for Computer Environments. A standard
developed by the IEEE based on UNIX.} and Win32) contain
functions which use operands that have data encoded as bits. For
example, POSIX systems maintain file permissions for three different
types of users: \emph{user} (a better name would be \emph{owner}),
\emph{group} and \emph{others}. Each type of user can be granted permission 
to read, write and/or execute a file. To change the permissions of a file
requires the C programmer to manipulate individual bits. POSIX defines
several macros to help (see Table~\ref{tab:posix}). The {\code chmod}
function can be used to set the permissions of file. This function
takes two parameters, a string with the name of the file to act on and
an integer\footnote{Actually a parameter of type {\code mode\_t} which
is a typedef to an integral type.} with the appropriate bits set for
the desired permissions. For example, the code below sets the
permissions to allow the owner of the file to read and write to it,
users in the group to read the file and others have no access.
\begin{lstlisting}[stepnumber=0]{}
chmod("foo", S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP );
\end{lstlisting}

The POSIX {\code stat} function can be used to find out the current 
permission bits for the file. Used with the {\code chmod} function, it
is possible to modify some of the permissions without changing others.
Here is an example that removes write access to others and adds read
access to the owner of the file. The other permissions are not altered.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]{}
struct stat file_stats;    /* struct used by stat() */
stat("foo", &file_stats);  /* read file info. 
                              file_stats.st_mode holds permission bits */
chmod("foo", (file_stats.st_mode & ~S_IWOTH) | S_IRUSR);
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Big and Little Endian Representations\index{endianess|(}}

Chapter~1 introduced the concept of big and little endian
representations of multibyte data. However, the author has found
that this subject confuses many people. This section covers the
topic in more detail. 

The reader will recall that endianness refers to the order that the
individual bytes (\emph{not} bits) of a multibyte data element is
stored in memory. Big endian is the most straightforward method. It
stores the most significant byte first, then the next significant byte
and so on. In other words the \emph{big} bits are stored first. Little
endian stores the bytes in the opposite order (least significant first).
The x86 family of processors use little endian representation.

As an example, consider the double word representing $12345678_{16}$. In
big endian representation, the bytes would be stored as 12~34~56~78. In
little endian represenation, the bytes would be stored as 78~56~34~12.

The reader is probably asking himself right now, why any sane chip
designer would use little endian representation? Were the engineers at
Intel sadists for inflicting this confusing representations on
multitudes of programmers? It would seem that the CPU has to do extra
work to store the bytes backward in memory like this (and to unreverse
them when read back in to memory). The answer is that the CPU does not
do any extra work to write and read memory using little endian format.
One has to realize that the CPU is composed of many electronic
circuits that simply work on bit values. The bits (and bytes) are not
in any necessary order in the CPU.

Consider the 2-byte {\code AX} register. It can be decomposed into the
single byte registers: {\code AH} and {\code AL}. There are circuits
in the CPU that maintain the values of {\code AH} and {\code
AL}. Circuits are not in any order in a CPU. That is, the circuits for
{\code AH} are not before or after the circuits for {\code AL}. A
{\code mov} instruction that copies the value of {\code AX} to memory
copies the value of {\code AL} then {\code AH}. This is not any harder
for the CPU to do than storing {\code AH} first.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{lstlisting}[stepnumber=0,frame=tblr, language=C]{}
  unsigned short word = 0x1234;   /* assumes sizeof(short) == 2 */
  unsigned char * p = (unsigned char *) &word;

  if ( p[0] == 0x12 )
    printf("Big Endian Machine\n");
  else
    printf("Little Endian Machine\n");
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{How to Determine Endianness \label{fig:determineEndian}}
\end{figure}

The same argument applies to the individual bits in a byte. They are
not really in any order in the circuits of the CPU (or memory for that
matter). However, since individual bits can not be addressed in the
CPU or memory, there is no way to know (or care about) what order they
seem to be kept internally by the CPU.

The C code in Figure~\ref{fig:determineEndian} shows how the
endianness of a CPU can be determined.  The \lstinline|p| pointer
treats the \lstinline|word| variable as a two element character
array. Thus, \lstinline|p[0]| evaluates to the first byte of
\lstinline|word| in memory which depends on the endianness of the CPU.

\subsection{When to Care About Little and Big Endian}

For typical programming, the endianness of the CPU is not
significant. The most common time that it is important is when binary
data is transferred between different computer systems. This is
usually either using some type of physical data media (such as a disk)
or a network. \MarginNote{With the advent of multibyte character sets,
like UNICODE\index{UNICODE}, endianness is important for even text data. UNICODE
supports either endianness and has a mechanism for specifying which
endianness is being used to represent the data.} Since ASCII data
is single byte, endianness is not an issue for it.

All internal TCP/IP headers store integers in big endian format
(called \emph{network byte order}). TCP/IP \index{TCP/IP}libraries provide C
functions for dealing with endianness issues in a portable way.  For
example, the \lstinline|htonl()| function converts a double word (or
long integer) from \emph{host} to \emph{network} format. The
\lstinline|ntohl()| function performs the opposite
transformation.\footnote{Actually, reversing the endianness of an
integer simply reverses the bytes; thus, converting from big to little
or little to big is the same operation. So both of these functions do
the same thing.} For a big endian system, the two functions just
return their input unchanged. This allows one to write network
programs that will compile and run correctly on any system
irrespective of its endianness. For more information, about endianness
and network programming see W. Richard Steven's excellent book, 
\emph{UNIX Network Programming}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tlrb, language=C]{}
unsigned invert_endian( unsigned x )
{
  unsigned invert;
  const unsigned char * xp = (const unsigned char *) &x;
  unsigned char * ip = (unsigned char *) & invert;

  ip[0] = xp[3];   /* reverse the individual bytes */
  ip[1] = xp[2];
  ip[2] = xp[1];
  ip[3] = xp[0];

  return invert;   /* return the bytes reversed */
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{invert\_endian Function \label{fig:invertEndian}\index{endianess!invert\_endian}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:invertEndian} shows a C function that inverts the
endianness of a double word. The 486 processor introduced a new
machine instruction named {\code BSWAP} \index{BSWAP} that reverses
the bytes of any 32-bit register. For example,
\begin{AsmCodeListing}[frame=none,numbers=none]
      bswap   edx          ; swap bytes of edx
\end{AsmCodeListing}
The instruction can not be used on 16-bit registers. However, the
{\code XCHG} \index{XCHG} instruction can be used to swap the bytes of
the 16-bit registers that can be decomposed into 8-bit registers. For
example:
\begin{AsmCodeListing}[frame=none,numbers=none]
      xchg    ah,al        ; swap bytes of ax
\end{AsmCodeListing}

\section{Counting Bits\index{counting bits|(}}

Earlier a straightforward technique was given for counting the number of bits
that are ``on'' in a double word. This section looks at other less direct
methods of doing this as an exercise using the bit operations discussed in
this chapter.


\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tblr, language=C]{}
int count_bits( unsigned int data )
{
  int cnt = 0;

  while( data != 0 ) {
    data = data & (data - 1);
    cnt++;
  }
  return cnt;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Bit Counting: Method One \label{fig:meth1}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Method one\index{counting bits!method one|(}}

The first method is very simple, but not obvious. Figure~\ref{fig:meth1} shows the code.

How does this method work? In every iteration of the loop, one bit is turned
off in {\code data}. When all the bits are off (\emph{i.e.} when {\code data}
is zero), the loop stops. The number of iterations required to make 
{\code data} zero is equal to the number of bits in the original value of
{\code data}.

Line~6 is where a bit of {\code data} is turned off. How does this work?
Consider the general form of the binary representation of {\code data} and
the rightmost 1 in this representation. By definition, every bit after this
1 must be zero. Now, what will be the binary representation of {\code data
- 1}? The bits to the left of the rightmost 1 will be the same as for
{\code data}, but at the point of the rightmost 1 the bits will be the 
complement of the original bits of {\code data}. For example:\\
\begin{tabular}{lcl}
{\code data}     & = & xxxxx10000 \\
{\code data - 1} & = & xxxxx01111
\end{tabular}\\
where the x's are the same for both numbers. When {\code data} is
\emph{AND}'ed with {\code data - 1}, the result will zero the rightmost
1 in {\code data} and leave all the other bits unchanged.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tlrb, language=C]{}
static unsigned char byte_bit_count[256];  /* lookup table */

void initialize_count_bits()
{
  int cnt, i, data;

  for( i = 0; i < 256; i++ ) {
    cnt = 0;
    data = i;
    while( data != 0 ) {	/* method one */
      data = data & (data - 1);
      cnt++;
    }
    byte_bit_count[i] = cnt;
  }
}

int count_bits( unsigned int data )
{
  const unsigned char * byte = ( unsigned char *) & data;

  return byte_bit_count[byte[0]] + byte_bit_count[byte[1]] +
         byte_bit_count[byte[2]] + byte_bit_count[byte[3]];
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Method Two \label{fig:meth2}}
\end{figure}
\index{counting bits!method one|)}

\subsection{Method two\index{counting bits!method two|(}}

A lookup table can also be used to count the bits of an arbitrary double
word. The straightforward approach would be to precompute the number of bits
for each double word and store this in an array. However, there are two
related problems with this approach. There are roughly \emph{4 billion}
double word values! This means that the array will be very big and that
initializing it will also be very time consuming. (In fact, unless one is 
going to actually use the array more than 4 billion times, more time will
be taken to initialize the array than it would require to just compute the
bit counts using method one!)

A more realistic method would precompute the bit counts for all possible
byte values and store these into an array. Then the double word can be
split up into four byte values. The bit counts of these four byte values
are looked up from the array and sumed to find the bit count of the 
original double word. Figure~\ref{fig:meth2} shows the to code implement
this approach.

The {\code initialize\_count\_bits} function must be called before the
first call to the {\code count\_bits} function. This function initializes
the global {\code byte\_bit\_count} array. The {\code count\_bits} function
looks at the {\code data} variable not as a double word, but as an array
of four bytes. The {\code dword} pointer acts as a pointer to this
four byte array. Thus, {\code dword[0]} is one of the bytes in {\code
data} (either the least significant or the most significant byte depending 
on if the hardware is little or big endian, respectively.) Of course, one
could use a construction like:
\begin{lstlisting}[stepnumber=0]{}
(data >> 24) & 0x000000FF
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent to find the most significant byte value and similar ones for the 
other bytes; however, these constructions will be slower than an array
reference.

One last point, a {\code for} loop could easily be used to compute the
sum on lines~22 and 23. But, a {\code for} loop would include the
overhead of initializing a loop index, comparing the index after each
iteration and incrementing the index. Computing the sum as the
explicit sum of four values will be faster. In fact, a smart compiler
would convert the {\code for} loop version to the explicit sum. This
process of reducing or eliminating loop iterations is a compiler
optimization technique known as \emph{loop unrolling}.

\subsection{Method three\index{counting bits!method three|(}}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tlrb, language=C]{}
int count_bits(unsigned int x )
{
  static unsigned int mask[] = { 0x55555555,
                                 0x33333333,
                                 0x0F0F0F0F,
                                 0x00FF00FF,
                                 0x0000FFFF };
  int i;
  int shift;   /* number of positions to shift to right */

  for( i=0, shift=1; i < 5; i++, shift *= 2 )
    x = (x & mask[i]) + ( (x >> shift) & mask[i] );
  return x;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Method 3 \label{fig:method3}}
\end{figure}

There is yet another clever method of counting the bits that are on in
data. This method literally adds the one's and zero's of the data together.
This sum must equal the number of one's in the data. For example, consider
counting the one's in a byte stored in a variable named {\code data}. The
first step is to perform the following operation:
\begin{lstlisting}[stepnumber=0]{}
data = (data & 0x55) + ((data >> 1) & 0x55);
\end{lstlisting}
What does this do? The hex constant {\code 0x55} is $01010101$ in
binary. In the first operand of the addition, {\code data} is
\emph{AND}'ed with this, bits at the odd bit positions are pulled
out. The second operand {\code ((data >> 1) \& 0x55)} first moves all
the bits at the even positions to an odd position and uses the same
mask to pull out these same bits. Now, the first operand contains the
odd bits and the second operand the even bits of {\code data}. When
these two operands are added together, the even and odd bits of {\code
data} are added together.  For example, if {\code data} is
$10110011_2$, then:\\
\begin{tabular}{rcr|l|l|l|l|}
\cline{4-7}
{\code data \&} $01010101_2$          &    &   & 00 & 01 & 00 & 01 \\
+ {\code (data >> 1) \&} $01010101_2$ & or & + & 01 & 01 & 00 & 01 \\
\cline{1-1} \cline{3-7}
                                      &    &   & 01 & 10 & 00 & 10 \\
\cline{4-7}
\end{tabular}

The addition on the right shows the actual bits added together. The bits of
the byte are divided into four 2-bit fields to show that actually there are
four independent additions being performed. Since the most these sums can be is
two, there is no possibility that the sum will overflow its field and corrupt
one of the other field's sums.

Of course, the total number of bits have not been computed yet. However, the
same technique that was used above can be used to compute the total in a
series of similar steps. The next step would be:
\begin{lstlisting}[stepnumber=0, language=C]{}
data = (data & 0x33) + ((data >> 2) & 0x33);
\end{lstlisting}
Continuing the above example (remember that {\code data} now is
$01100010_2$):\\
\begin{tabular}{rcr|l|l|}
\cline{4-5}
{\code data \&} $00110011_2$          &    &   & 0010 & 0010 \\
+ {\code (data >> 2) \&} $00110011_2$ & or & + & 0001 & 0000 \\
\cline{1-1} \cline{3-5}
                                      &    &   & 0011 & 0010 \\
\cline{4-5}
\end{tabular}\\
Now there are two 4-bit fields to that are independently added. 

The next step is to add these two bit sums together to form the final
result:
\begin{lstlisting}[stepnumber=0, language=C]{}
data = (data & 0x0F) + ((data >> 4) & 0x0F);
\end{lstlisting} 

Using the example above (with {\code data} equal to $00110010_2$):\\
\begin{tabular}{rcrl}
{\code data \&} $00001111_2$          &    &   & 00000010 \\
+ {\code (data >> 4) \&} $00001111_2$ & or & + & 00000011 \\
\cline{1-1} \cline{3-4}
                                      &    &   & 00000101 \\
\end{tabular}\\
Now {\code data} is 5 which is the correct result. Figure~\ref{fig:method3}
shows an implementation of this method that counts the bits in a double word.
It uses a {\code for} loop to compute the sum. It would be faster to 
unroll the loop; however, the loop makes it clearer how the method
generalizes to different sizes of data.
